# O4FM Docs

- `/docs/digital-protocol.md`
  - O4FM digital payload protocol (logical header, mode field, fragmentation rules)
- `/docs/analog-protocol.md`
  - O4FM analog link profile and audio-port operating constraints (passthrough/processing chain, device and level guidance)

## Scope

- This repository currently focuses on digital transport over analog FM radio audio ports.
- Documentation is split into a digital payload spec and an analog link spec so each layer can evolve independently.
